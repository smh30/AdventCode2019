## My solutions to the 2019 Advent of Code problems

Last year, after coming back to the problems over several months, I finally got stuck on day 11. I'm interested to see if I can do better this time. 

I'll be primarily attempting the problems in PHP, since that's what I'm using in my internship at the moment and I'm hoping that the problems will give me a chance to learn more about it. I may end up trying some other language if the mood takes me. Just aiming to complete the problems, not competing on speed.
